## 07.K-Means Clustering
 
 __K-means clustering__ is a type of __unsupervised learning__, which is used when you have __unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups)__. 
> __The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K__. <br>

- The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. <br>
- Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.<br>

The results of the __K-means clustering algorithm__ are:
1. The centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data
2. Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster)
