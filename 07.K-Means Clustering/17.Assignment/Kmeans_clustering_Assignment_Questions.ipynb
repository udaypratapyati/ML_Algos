    "- In today's competitive world, it is crucial to understand customer bahaviour and categorise customers based on their demography and buying behaviour. This is broadly one aspect of customer segmentation that allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets in terms of promotional, marketing and product development strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective__<br/>\n",
    "- This assignment demonstrates the concept of segmentation of a customer dataset from an e-commerce site using k-means clustering in python. You will use the kmeans and the hierarchical clustering algorithms to derive the optimum number of clusters and understand the underlying customer segments based on the data provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "__About the dataset__<br/>\n",
    "- The dataset consists of Annual income (in `$`000) and their annual spend (in `$`000) on an e-commerce site for a period of one year. Let us explore the data using numpy and pandas libraries in python."
